# TrustFund-application
This is a crowdfunding decentralised application that uses blockchain technology to gather funds to persons with innovative ideas and the people who are in need. Used smart contracts to handle all campaign activities. Utilised React for the front end, the NodeJS framework for the back end, and Solidity to create the smart contract.
